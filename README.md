# FauveEdit

## Apply the Fauve pseudo-color effect to images

The Fauve effect pseudo-colors pixels according to how popular their original color values are in the image. The algorithm increases contrast, enhances edges, adds texture, alters the palette, and reduces spatial cohesion. Here are some[http://ffrend.blogspot.com/2011/12/good-news-everyone-ffrend-project-has.html](examples).

The project was originally a [https://github.com/victimofleisure/ckffplugs](Freeframe plugin) in 2011. In 2022 it became a desktop application called FauveEdit. Various enhancements followed, including:
* Cropping
* Luma histogram with adjustable min and max levels
* Hue shifting with animation
* Video export
* Parallel processing to improve render speed

More recently the application was ported to Direct2D for improved scaling performance and quality.
